# Some

More than less

A program to show contents of files or piped input from stdin

### Usage
```bash
$ cat hello | some
## OR
$ some foo.bar
```

### Goals

- [x] Pipe input from stdin
- [x] Read from file arg
- [ ] Wrap text
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Horizontal scroll instead of wrap toggle
- [ ] Lazy loading of files (to make larger files responsive)
- [ ] Support for syntax highlighting
